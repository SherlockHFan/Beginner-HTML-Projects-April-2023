<!-- Absolute file path and Relative file path practice -->
<!-- The differences between Absolute and Relative file paths are: -->
<!-- Absolute file paths lead directly to a specific folder or file,
    ex: C:/Document/File.pdf | MAC-> /Document/File.pdf, and are often longer -->
<!-- Relative file paths provide directions to a file based on relative locations,
    ex: /Image/pickaxe.jpg. Relative file paths are often shorter,
    and can have files moved anywhere and still be referenced ex: /Document/Toolbox.png
    moved to /Images/Toolbox.png. Due to being longer, for web development Relative Files 
    are preferred.-->
<!-- Special Characters -->
<!--Special characters can be used to make coding easier. Types of special characters:
    + ../ (../Pokemon.png)-> Used to go up a level, or go back/out of one location to another
    + ./ (./Walmart.html)-> Used to stay and search in the current directory.

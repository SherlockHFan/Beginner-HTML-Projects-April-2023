<!-- CSS Selectors are used to determine where to apply CSS-->
<!-- CSS Refresher- CSS is added by the below:
                  color:blue <--Value  
                   ^-Property-->
<!-- CSS Selectors 'select' what CSS to apply to the above rules
  - Ex- h1{   <--The h1 in this case is a element selector for the h1 tags
    color:blue
  }
  - Most times correctly coded HTML will only have one h1 to target multiple instances
    of the same tag, eleminating the need to add messy code.
  - -->
<!-- Class Selectors Ex: '.' 
      -Class selectors such as '.', are used with no spaces before the name of the class.
        Class selectors are applied to ALL of the tags with the same name.
              Ex- 
              index.html
              1. <h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>
              2. <h2>Green</h2>
              3. <h2>Blue</h2>
              
              styles.css
              1. .red-text{
              2.  color:red;
              3. }
      Class selectors are added after the tag-> <h2> class="".           
    -->
<!-- ID Selctor 
  - Defined by the '#' before a sequence, the id selector can not have 
    any spaces. Ex <h2 id="main" <-- 'main' is the id for this selector sequence.
    -------------- 
    Ex-
    index.html

    
    ___---____

    blank.css
      #main {
      color: red
    }

    ---------------
    - Any id attribute will be affected by this selector, if they are the same.
-->
<!-- Class Selector Vs. ID Selector
  
  -Class selector: Class selectors can be applied to many elements
                   Very versatile. You can group parts of your HTML into the 
                   same styling. Can be applied to as many elements as you want.

  -ID Selector: Id selectors can only be applied to one (1) element
                in a single html file. These names should be unique to 
                only one element. Good to use when one element is needed 
                for something specific, like below:

                index.html
                ----------
                <h2 id="Robin">Teal</h2>
                <h2 id

                styles.css
                ----------
                #Robin{
                  color:teal;
                }
                .blue-text{

                }


-->
<!-- Attribute Selector
    - Attribute selectors 
    - Ex- 
      index.html
    -------------
    <p draggable="true">DRAG HONEY</p>
    <p>Not draggeble, BooHoo</p>
    <p>Not dragable, BooHoo</p>
      styles.css             <-- Example 1.3
    ---------------
        p[draggable]{  <-- This makes all paragraph elements draggable, and
      color: pink      <-- make the color red when being dragged. Works because its text, might not for images.
    }
    
    - You can select elements and give them specific attributes, such as draggable
      and apply CSS styles to them. You could also say whether attributes are "false"
      or "true" in cases of one element being different then another. 
      Ex- <p draggable="false">Not draggable, BooHoo</p>
      
      Example 1.3 can be written the way it is now, or it could be changed by
      adding another rule in the style.css file, which would make only draggable
      paragraphs with "false" red. 

      Example-
      styles.css
      -----------
      p[draggable="false"]{
        color: red;
      }
    
    
    --> 
<!-- Universal Selector - Defined by a "*"(asterik)
  - Selects everything in the html and applies the rules to it.
    Example- 
            *{
              color:violet
            }
    This selector can be applied regardless of any elements, attributes, or 
    other styles.
